At some point, every developer out there as had the need to get their hands on some dummy data.  More often than not,
that data, be it in a test, in a script, etc. that data takes the form of something like the following

```kotlin
val testerino = MyAwesomeClass(
  name = "hi",
  date = LocalDate(2022, 1, 1),
  reason = "potato"
  age = 1337
)
```

This is boring at best, and potentially dangerous at worst.  If we rely on dumb data to test our code, we expose ourselves
to bugs via oversight and unidentified biases.  Much in the same vein as [property testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing),
we can gain increased confidence in our tests by exposing them to a larger range of potential inputs.

With a bit of reasoning providing wind in our sails, let's see what's already out there!
