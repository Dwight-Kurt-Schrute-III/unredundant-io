Building a portfolio site is a rite of passage for many developers.  In days past, I myself have attempted to write
one on _at least_ 10 occasions, all of which were varying degrees of hideous failures.  I believe my
first attempt was around 2013, and I desperately wish I had the code (or at least screenshots).  It would be the website
equivalent of [/r/blunderyears](https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/) ðŸ¤£

However, we live in a truly magical time.  An age in which a no-talent, UI-clueless developer like myself can _actually_ build
a respectable website without spending _toooo_ much time slamming their heads into a wall.  In this post, I'll take you through
the steps I took when making the first iteration of this website.  Likely, this will drift over time, and I will almost
definitely _not_ come back and update this post with changes I make to the site.  For reference, you can find the exact
commit when I'm writing this code [here](https://github.com/unredundant/unredundant-io/tree/530750d57492db1c4fd8df872651c87f1b797f1f).

Before we begin, let's get some disclaimers out of the way.

## Setting the groundwork

As I've alluded to, I am a backend engineer by trade, and my knowledge of front end best practice is fleeting at best.

I based most of the technical decisions of this project on a combination of newsletter project hype and simply what I
was able to get working.  Given the rate at which the Javascript ecosystem changes, this will likely be completely out of
date by the end of the month (I'm writing this on February 3rd, 2022).

ðŸš€ Without further ado... let's get building ðŸš€

## Boilerplate

I chose [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) as my React framework.  It is without question the web framework-du-jour, and anecdotally,
I have nothing but praise so far.  It touts itself as "The React Framework for Production" and it seems to be just that.

It gets you from 0 to launch on the first day, and has a bevy of powerful features, so it can grow with your application.

Bootstrapping a new NextJS project is insanely easy.  Assuming you have [NodeJS]() available on your `$PATH`, you can simply run

```
> npx create-next-app@latest --ts my-portfolio
```

The `--ts` stands for TypeScript, an addition that I consider non-negotiable.  Coming from my statically-typed background,
dealing with masses of untyped data is something I find completely unacceptable.  I'm willing to accept a slightly higher
barrier to entry, knowing that it will pay dividends in the future.

`my-portfolio` is going to be the name of the project it creates.  Change this to anything that floats your boat.

Going ahead and `cd` into that newly minted directory.

At this point, you already have a fully deployable web app, jam-packed with a bunch of awesome developer experience tooling.

Go ahead and run `yarn dev` and head over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should also be able to see a collection of files that looks something like the following.

![cra-boilerplate](/post/building-portfolio-site/cra-boilerplate.png)

You can ignore most of these for now. The majority of our work is going to be inside the `pages` folder.

Before we start making any actual content, let's get our UI library in place!

## UI

No offense to the boilerplate NextJS page, but it's not much of a looker.  Very reminiscent of those Bootstrap UI
applications that were all the rage back in the mid 2010s.  Let's spice it up using [NextUI](https://nextui.org/).
Despite the name, there is no _actual_ relation to NextJS (at least to my knowledge).

```
> yarn add @nextui-org/react next-themes
```

`next-themes` is a nice quality-of-life library that makes adding multiple themes super easy.  In this tutorial we will
only add a single theme, but I want to set you up for big success ðŸ˜‰

Head on over to `pages/_app.tsx` and overwrite it with the following

```typescript
// TODO
```

## GraphQL

## Hosting
